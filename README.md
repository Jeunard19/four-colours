# Four Color Graph Project

This project implements the Four Color Theorem for graphs and visualizes the results using **PyVis**.

## Requirements

You need **Python 3** and the `pyvis` library.

Install `pyvis` with:

```bash
pip install pyvis
```

## Usage

1. **Run the main program**:

```bash
python four_color.py
```

2. **Run unit tests**:

```bash
python four_color_test.py
```

## Customization

You can modify the adjacency matrix directly in the code to test different graphs.
Look for the variable `adj` in `four_color.py` to make your changes.
